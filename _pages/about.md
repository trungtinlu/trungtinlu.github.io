My name is Trung Tin. I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree in **Electrical and Computer Engineering** at Sungkuynkwan University. I'm now working at SKKU Automation Lab under the supervision of Professor Jae Wook Jeon. I received my B.S. in Control Engineering and Automation in Honour Program at Vietnam National University - Ho Chi Minh University of Technology (VNU-HCMUT) in 2025. My current research focuses on motion control and control theory for electric machine drive system.

Research Interests
------
* **Motion Control:** Developing and applying Field Oriented Control (FOC) with advanced control techinques to enhance the performance and stability of PMSM Drive Systems.
* **Apdaptive Nonlinear Control:** Focusing on state observer (such as Extend State Observer, RBFNN Observer) to estimate the disturbance and uncertainty in PMSM Drive System.

Awards
------
* **Five goods student arward (2025):** Awarded by Vietnam National Union of Students.
