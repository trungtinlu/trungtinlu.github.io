Currently, I am part of the SKKU Automation Lab, where my research is centered on motion control and robust control for the PMSM Drive system.

**Undergraduate Project**

Since 2023, I've joined Pham Minh Duc's Lab at HCMUT. Additionally, I've also collaborated on several projects with Prof. Ho Pham Huy Anh and MSc Nguyen Tien Dat. My projects focus on applying adaptive control theory and sensorless control for PMSM Drive system.
